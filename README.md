Q: Why Java?
A: Portability and familiarity! Most of my programming experience, professionally and recreationally, is object-oriented - primarily C++ and C#. While I could use NodeJS with something like typescript or similar since this is more along the lines of a webapp/webserver, I'm not as familair with them, and while I use C++ and C# more, the platform flexibility of Java makes it easier for myself and other people to develop on and for a wide range of devices and device architecures without as much fiddling.

Q: Why Eclipse?
A: It's robust enough, free enough, and functional enough. New feature additions in the last few years have made it something I've come to enjoy using more. It may not be my preferred IDE, but it's a reliable IDE.
