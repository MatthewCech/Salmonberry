# Salmonberry
Salmonberry is an experimental roguelite server system written in Java.

Q: Why java?
A: Portability and familiarity! Most of my programming experience, professionally and recreationally, is object-oriented - primarily C++ and C#. While I could use NodeJS with something like typescript or similar since this is more along the lines of a webapp/webserver, I'm not as familair with them, and while I use C++ and C# more, the platform flexibility of Java makes it easier for myself and other people to develop on and for a wide range of devices and device architecures without as much fiddling.

Q: Why is this Q&A section so short?
A: I haven't gotten any other questions yet!
